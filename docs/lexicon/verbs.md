# Verbs

For verbs in Malayalam, there are debates on how to represent them in a lexicon. Should it be root words or Citation forms?

For example, the verb ഓടുക is written in its citation form(നടുവിനയെച്ചം). Citation form is the form they appear in dictionaries. But the actual root form, non-inflected root form of this verb is ഓട്. Similary കൊല്ലുക vs കൊൽ. In our lexicon we use citation forms in lexicon since they are complete and easy to read, recognize. All verbal inflections are processed over this citation forms.
