# Frequently asked questions

**Why this is written in English?**

It may be argued that a documentation on Malayalam morphology could be written better in Malayalam language itself. From my past experiences with documenting Malayalam computational linguistic and typography related topics, I found that if it is written in a lingua franca like English, it serves more people. The target audience for this documentation is moderately educated people in linguistics. Often they are not native Malayalam speakers. Secondly, I found it very hard to connect with linguistic discourses in non-Malayalam languages when I referred Malayalam only grammar books. These books often does not give corresponding English vocabulary for key topics. Not having a bridge from Malayalam to general linguistic discouse in world languages made my learning difficult.

**Can I learn grammar from this documentation?**

No. This is an interpretation of Malayalam grammar for computational purpose. It does not claim completeness or correctness. The approach is descriptive grammar because of the usecase. This documentation mostly try to see every word as a sequence of bytes and every grammatical function as some string processing function. There are many other important aspects to grammar and this does not serve that function.
