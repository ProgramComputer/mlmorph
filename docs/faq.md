**Why this is written in English?**

It may be argued that a documentation on Malayalam morphology could be written better in Malayalam language itself. From my past experiences with documenting Malayalam computational linguistic and typography related topics, I found that if it is written in a lingua franca like English, it serves more people. The target audience for this documentation is moderately educated people in linguistics. Often they are not native Malayalam speakers. Secondly, I found it very hard to connect with linguistic discourses in non-Malayalam languages when I referred Malayalam only grammar books. These books often does not give corresponding English vocabulary for key topics. Not having a bridge from Malayalam to general linguistic discouse in world languages made my learning difficult.
