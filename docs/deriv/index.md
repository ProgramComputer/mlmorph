# Derivational morphology

Members of one major grammatical category can be derived from those of the
same or another category by the addition of suffixes to a stem.

For example, Nouns can be derived from Verbs and vice-versa. Nouns can also be derived from Nouns.

Derivational morphology deals with the above mentioned derivations and causes a massive production for vocabulary of the languages.
